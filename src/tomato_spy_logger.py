#  Assume the user is logged in to Mac
# [todo] - subtract sleep time
#  For now assume all time logged in is non-sleep time



# ---------------- Deamon ---------------------------------------


# I started enter to db w time/date stamp



# Every few minutes
    # updates end-time
        # if newtime > interval:
            # Create a new entry for start-time
    # recurse (never graduate)


# - Interval should be ~ 1 min or maybe ~30s.





# ----------------- Client ---------------------------------------

# enters to db - work start times / work end times  etc

# plot it puls all from same db

# All time this script is running goes to Total time.
# All time that the timer is running goes to Work time.
# All time the break-timer is running goes to break time.

#  Calculate:
#  procrastination = total - work
#  Break time  = break time

# Day:  <-- smallest unit

# Total
# Procrastination
# Work (time logged)
# breaks

# Calculate the above metrics for From Date - Date

# Plots:  <--- once you log in to terminal
